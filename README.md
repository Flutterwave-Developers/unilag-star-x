# DocNotes

The quickest and most organized way to keep track of patient's records

This helps solve problems faced by doctors when keeping track of patient's records. In a standard setting, a doctor would have to document all his observations in physical notes and they are stored in files sometimes with images of the patient. When it's time to go through patient's info they have to start searching for every record they have.

DocNotes stores all the notes about a patient by the doctor in a digital form. Images, videos, recordings can also be attached with the patient's info which makes tracking patient's health improvement over time better.
